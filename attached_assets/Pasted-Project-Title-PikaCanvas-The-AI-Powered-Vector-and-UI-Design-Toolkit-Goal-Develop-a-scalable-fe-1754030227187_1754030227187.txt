Project Title: PikaCanvas: The AI-Powered Vector and UI Design Toolkit

Goal: Develop a scalable, feature-rich SaaS platform that provides a complete solution for creating beautiful and professional digital assets in a Pika.style-like web application. The platform will feature a powerful, browser-based vector editor and a separate asset management and generation module.

The entire application will be built with a monorepo structure, deployed serverlessly on Vercel, and optimized for a seamless user experience.

Core Principles for Development:

Modern Web Standards: Utilize the latest technologies and best practices for a fast, secure, and responsive application.

Serverless First: All backend logic will be designed as stateless Vercel Serverless Functions to ensure infinite scalability and a pay-per-use cost model. We will carefully select libraries that are compatible with Vercel's runtime environment.

Vercel-Optimized Deployment: The project will use a monorepo with frontend/ (Next.js) and backend/ (FastAPI) directories, each with its own vercel.json file for "two-click" deployment.

User Experience (UX) Focused: The UI/UX will be clean, intuitive, and beautiful, making complex tasks feel simple. The editor will provide a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) experience, with a focus on a polished, professional aesthetic. The design will feature a light/dark mode toggle and a consistent, elegant color palette.

Robust Authentication: Implement a secure, production-ready authentication system with distinct user roles (User, Admin).

Scalable Infrastructure: Leverage managed, serverless services for the database and file storage to support growth without infrastructure overhead.

Monetization Ready: The platform will be built with a tiered subscription model, managed by a fully integrated payment processor.

Research & Competitive Analysis:
The inspiration comes from tools like Pika.style and other online design editors. The key differentiator will be the focus on a powerful vector engine and AI-driven asset generation, all within a beautiful, modern, and high-performance web application.

This is a powerful, integrated value proposition.

Technical Stack Recommendations & Justification:

Frontend:

Framework: Next.js (React Framework)

Why: Provides the ideal foundation for a performant, component-based application with robust routing and Vercel's built-in optimizations.

Authentication: Clerk

Why: Seamlessly integrates with Next.js and Vercel, providing a secure and fully featured user management system with minimal custom code.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (with Shadcn UI components)

Why: Enables rapid and consistent UI development for the dashboards and marketing pages. The focus on a beautiful design with light/dark mode is easily achieved with Tailwind's utility-first approach.

Editor Frontend Technologies:

Vector Graphics Library: A powerful library like Fabric.js, Paper.js, or Konva.js will be used to create the canvas, handle SVG elements, and manage the complex drawing and manipulation logic.

Drag-and-Drop Library: A library like @dnd-kit/core will be used for drag-and-drop functionality of elements onto the canvas from the sidebar.

UI/UX Focus: Custom-designed icons, elegant transitions, and a meticulously crafted component library will be built on top of Shadcn UI to create a high-end feel.

Backend:

Framework: FastAPI (Python)

Why: High-performance, asynchronous, and well-suited for both the image generation and the SVG/Vector logic. Its support for Vercel functions is a perfect fit.

Database & File Storage: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Storage)

Why: The managed PostgreSQL database will store all user data, design project metadata, and generated assets. Supabase Storage will hold the SVG files, rasterized images, and other creative assets. This simplifies the tech stack greatly.

Payment Processing: Stripe

Why: The industry standard for handling subscriptions and managing customer billing.

AI-Powered Generation (Serverless-Compatible):

Service: A text-to-image API (e.g., Stability AI, DALL-E) and/or a text-to-SVG service if available. The backend will simply make API calls to these services, avoiding local dependency issues on Vercel.

Asset Export (for the Editor):

Libraries: A pure Python library for image manipulation like Pillow to handle rasterization of the SVG and canvas data for PNG/JPG exports. For SVG exports, the raw vector data from the frontend can be saved directly.

Detailed Feature Requirements & Implementation Steps:

Project Setup (Monorepo with Vercel):

Repository Structure: Create frontend/ and backend/ folders at the root of the monorepo.

Vercel Configuration: Use a root vercel.json file to define both frontend and backend as separate projects, enabling independent deployment and optimized builds on Vercel.

Frontend (Next.js with Clerk, Tailwind, Shadcn UI):

Overall UI/UX Philosophy:

Minimalist & Clean: The design will prioritize clarity and reduce visual clutter. Ample whitespace will be used to guide the user's eye.

Intuitive Workflow: Complex tasks will be broken down into simple, logical steps. The interface will feel natural to navigate for both novice and experienced users.

Responsive Design: The application will be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) for a consistent experience across devices.

Accessibility: Adhere to WCAG guidelines where possible, ensuring good contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes for screen readers.

Theming (Light/Dark Mode):

Root-level Implementation: Implement light and dark themes using CSS variables managed by Tailwind CSS. A global context provider will handle theme switching, ensuring all components respect the chosen theme.

Persistent Preference: User's theme preference will be saved in local storage to persist across sessions.

Toggle Component: A visually appealing toggle button (e.g., moon/sun icon) will be prominently placed, likely in the header, for users to switch between modes. Transitions between modes will be smooth and subtle.

Authentication & Dashboard:

Authentication Flow: Utilize Clerk's pre-built UI components for secure and user-friendly sign-up, sign-in, password reset, and user profile management.

/api/asset/generate (POST): Receives a text prompt and any optional style parameters from the frontend. Calls the chosen AI text-to-image/vector service API. Saves the generated asset (image file or SVG string) to Supabase Storage, and stores a reference in the database. Returns a URL or data URI of the generated asset to the frontend.

/api/asset/export (POST): Receives the project's canvas data (e.g., a serialized SVG string from Fabric.js) and the desired export format (PNG, JPG, SVG).

For PNG/JPG: Uses Pillow to rasterize the SVG/canvas data into the specified image format.

For SVG: Saves the raw SVG string.

Uploads the generated file to Supabase Storage. Returns a secure, temporary download URL to the frontend.
